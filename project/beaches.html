        <p>There are over 550 miles of shores and coastlines throughout Cape Cod with more than 60 popular beaches to choose from. The most popular beaches are those that are located in towns that often see the biggest amount of tourists. However, each beach on the Cape is unique and offers a number of opportunities for visitors to enjoy the sandy shore.</p>
        <p>One of the most popular beaches on Cape Cod is Nauset Beach in the town of Orleans. Off of exit 12, Nauset Beach provides visitors with plenty of parking spaces and a long stretch of soft sand and open ocean. Nauset is located on the side of the seashore but is not a part of the National Seashore Natonal Park. The ocean has sand bars in the morning and crystal clear water.</p>
        <p>Another popular beach is Marconi Beach located in Wellfleet. This beach is part of the National Seashore and shows the years of erosion with steep sand dunes that shoulder Marconi Beach. Visitors have the opportunity to buy an $80 annual pass for National Parks that includes any beach on Cape Cod that is part of the National Seashore. Marconi Beach often has dozesn of seals that swim accross the shore and sun themselves on the sand bars.</p>
