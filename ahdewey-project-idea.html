<p> For this project, I plan to make a website with information about Cape Cod encouraging people to visit the area.  The homepage will be an “about” section where there will be information about the Cape.  A second page will be dedicated to the different beaches people can go to with different activities to do there such as whale watching, surfing lessons and more.  A third page will be about the Cape Cod Baseball League, informing people about the daily games, how to get there and background information on the league.  I plan to use my personal knowledge about Cape Cod as well as different sources to ensure that this website will be a good place to find extensive information about the area and make people want to visit.
