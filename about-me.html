<h1>About Me</h1>
<body> 
<h2> Background Information </h2>
<p>I am 20 year-old student at Syracuse University from East Greenbush, New York, a small town outside of Albany. I have two older brothers and a dog named Tucker. My dad, uncle and brother all graduated from Syracuse University, making SU a big school in my family. During the summer, I love going to Cape Cod, bringing my dog to the beach and spending time with my friends and family.
</p>
<h2> Education </h2>
<p>I am currently a junior in the Newhouse School of Public Communications studying Public Relations. My minor is in the school of Information Studies and I hope to use the skills that I learn from PR and IMT following my graduation next year. Over the summer I had an internship with the Cape Cod Baseball League as a Public Relations Intern. This experience has gotten me interested in pursuing a job in Sports PR.</p>
