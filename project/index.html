        <p>Cape Cod was first settled by European explorers in the early 1600s. The first towns that were setteld were Sandwich, Barnstable and Yarmouth along the bay. The Wampanoag tribe who had already been settled on the Cape taught the settlers useful skills to live on the land. </p>
        <p>Tourism started to boom during the 19th century when people in Boston started to travel to the Cape. Tourism continued to grow as a train service from Boston was built and reached Sandwich in 1848 and up to Provincetown by 1873. From there, factors like building the Cape Cod highway, the establishment of the National Seashore and the Kennedy family vacationing in Hyannis attracted more and more people.</p>
